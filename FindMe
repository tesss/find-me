Plans
- Release for VivoActive and all other devices (already implemented, but needed more testing on real devices).
- Mobile Android & iOS app-companion (the main key feature). Planned functionality:
    |- Adding location from OSM map
    |- Search by coordinates, type, address
    |- Import from other apps (e.g. Google Maps) and gpx tracks

Notes & bugs
- App settings aren't saved after error
- Memory leaks after several added locations (some platform-related bug, investigating)
- May crash if locations count is near limit (lack of memory, will be optimised in next versions)
- Sorting by name takes a lot of time (ConnectIQ limitation of string methods)
