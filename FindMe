FAQ
- To input location name on those device which doesn't support keyboard input (e.g. vivoactive):
    |- Tap up/down side of screen to change current character (limited to small chars, numbers and a few spec symbols)
    |- Tap left/right side of screen to move to prev/next character
    |- Default location name for adding current location is loc_yyMMddhhmm, where yy is current year, MM - month, dd - day, hh - hour, mm - minute
    |- If you don't want to change default name, just tap 15 times on the right side (location name is limited up to 15 symbols), spaces on the start/end will be truncated 
    |- If future I'll develop more convenient way of input, but the main idea will be creating waypoints in the future mobile app

- Indicator for gps signal quality (top left icon on location view)
    |- Hidden: location is unknown
    |- White: using last known position (if gps fix was more than 10 sec ago, status become last known)
    |- Red: quality poor
    |- Yellow: quality usable
    |- Green: quality good
- Indicator for activity recording (top right icon on location view)
- If location is closer than 20m it shows circle instead of arrow and vibrates
- If distance filter is enabled, it shows only near locations with defined radius (if gps found)
- Distance units from watch settings
- Use update gps interval settings to reduce battery using (based on different devices battery use tesing)
- Manual update interval hits gps only after pressing Start button in Location view (vibrates)
- Delete All removes all locations of current type
- Reset deletes all locations and resets settings to default
- You can check all locations count in About view
----------------------------------------------------------
Plans
- Release for all other devices (already implemented, needs more testing on real devices).
- Mobile Android & iOS app-companion (the main key feature). Planned functionality:
    |- Adding location from OSM map
    |- Search by coordinates, type, address
    |- Import from other apps (e.g. Google Maps) and gpx tracks
----------------------------------------------------------
Donation
- If you like app you can support project (which I'm implementing in the gaps of free time) with donation to bitcoin wallet 3DrK1Hi6bn35qdBo1ZVVswASp77hT6fudy
- I'll be very appreciated for any support, it will speed up developing next versions and mobile app
----------------------------------------------------------
Notes & bugs
- Memory leaks after several added locations (some platform-related bug)
- May crash if locations count is near limit (lack of memory, will be optimised in next versions)
- Sorting by name takes a lot of time (ConnectIQ limitation of string methods)
